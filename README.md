# Composite Repository for Robotics Final Project
## Includes all four repositories corresponding to each use case

This is to turn in a single repository for all four use cases. Each subfolder is a [submodule](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules) which is a clone of the original repository.   

`multi_robot_slam` corresponds to use case 1: using SLAM for object and collision avoidance on multiple robots. \
`robotic_voice_control` corresponds to use case 2: controlling robots using voice commands. \
`gazebo_web` corresponds to use case 3: the webUI interface for manually controlling the robot. \
`colored_map` corresponds to use case 4: the colorized point cloud map. 

Please see each README in each sub-repo for more details. The list below and the Deliverable include links to the separate repositories, in case that is easier to grade. The Report details the methodology of each use case as well. Link to (Deliverable)[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BvP3A6TscvI9IWH-7xo1sIda5NOz44Kcm6HQ_p17fkA/edit#] and to (Report)[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HYHzrBABwhQ5arZjzpRC4l4Nq4USkz0zM361vomXZdg/edit#].

There are instructions for how to use the first three use cases simultaneously in the Deliverable report, under the subheading `Integration of the First Three Use Cases`.
